# Module1

This is a simple sense-think-act system. We are using PIR motion sensor, LED, Arduino UNO and Resistor. 
Sense: The PIR motion detects the motion by sensing infrared rays from the moving object.
Think: The Arduino will process the PIR signal.
Act: If the motion is detected, the LED will turn on for 5 seconds.
